<h2>Andrew Hahm</h2>

<p>
I am a PhD candidate in the politics department at Princeton. My dissertation project tentatively aims to develop an account of the political morality of administrative and welfare institutions in democratic societies. I also have more general interests in democratic theory and normative political theory.

<p>
I hold an MA in philosophy from Queen's University, Kingston, where I was a Fulbright student; and a BA in math from Princeton, where I was a student of no particular distinction.
